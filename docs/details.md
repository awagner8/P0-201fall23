## Starter Code and Using Git
**_You should have installed all software (Java, Git, VS Code) before completing this project._** You can find the [directions for installation here](hhttps://coursework.cs.duke.edu/201fall23/resources-201/-/blob/main/installingSoftware.md) (including workarounds for submitting without Git if needed).

We'll be using Git and the installation of GitLab at [coursework.cs.duke.edu](https://coursework.cs.duke.edu). All code for classwork will be kept here. Git is software used for version control, and GitLab is an online repository to store code in the cloud using Git.

**[This document details the workflow](https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/201fall23/resources-201/-/blob/main/projectWorkflow.md) for downloading the starter code for the project, updating your code on coursework using Git, and ultimately submitting to Gradescope for autograding.** We recommend that you read and follow the directions carefully this first time working on a project! While coding, we recommend that you periodically (perhaps when completing a method or small section) push your changes as explained in Section 5.


## Coding in Project P0: Person201

When you fork and clone the project, **make sure you open the correct project folder in VS Code** following the [directions shown here](https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/201fall23/resources-201/-/blob/main/projectWorkflow.md#step-3-open-the-project-in-vs-code).

You will be working primarily with the `.java` files in the `src` folder beginning with `Person201.java`. You will modify two programs/classes (`Person201.java`,  `Person201Demo.java`), and will run `Person201NearbyDemo.java` to see if your changes are working. Then you will create a new program called `Person201Fartheset.java`.
